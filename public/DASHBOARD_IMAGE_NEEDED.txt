Please create an image file named 'admission-dashboard.webp' in this directory.

This image will be displayed in the MacBook scroll component on the homepage.

For best results:
1. Use a high-resolution screenshot of your admission dashboard UI
2. Use a 16:10 aspect ratio (typical MacBook screen)
3. Make sure the image is clear and represents your application well

You can run 'npm run check-components' to verify if the image is properly set up.
